Warning:
  This library is STILL in active development.

This is a backend web framework in cpp. This is inspired by the problem that most cpp web frameworks do not have any ORMs for database operations to be made easy. Those that
do do not offer that much functionality. Most of them are just a http(s) library with no support for database operations. This framework aims to change that by extending 
those http(s) libraries (i aim to use the http library in the repo octobanana/belle for this purpose) with database functionality.
